Please refer to the PDF for additional details on the project.

* If you are taking this test in Objective-C
  * For the first problem, you must implement `processWebsiteVisits` in `WebsiteVisitObjectiveC.m`. You may add helper functions if you need them, but they must all be added inside this file.
  * For the second problem, you must implement `findPathToNode` in `ViewHierarchyObjectiveC.m`. You may add helper functions if you need them, but they must all be added inside this file.

  * When you are done, you must submit `WebsiteVisitObjectiveC.m` and `ViewHierarchyObjectiveC.m` *only*. As stated above, if you needed to add any additional code, you must do it within these files. You are not allowed to modify any other file.
* If you are taking this test in Swift
  * For the first problem, you must implement `processWebsiteVisits` in `WebsiteVisit+Solution.swift`. You may add helper functions if you need them, but they must all be added inside this file.
  * For the second problem, you must implement `findPathToNode` in `ViewHierarchy+Solution.swift`. You may add helper functions if you need them, but they must all be added inside this file.

  * Both functions will contain some stub code. Feel free to delete that code before adding your implementation.
  * When you are done, you must submit `WebsiteVisit+Solution.swift` and `ViewHierarchy+Solution.swift` *only*. As stated above, if you needed to add any additional code, you must do it within these files. You are not allowed to modify any other file.

* Regardless of which languange you use, there are 4 unit tests for each problem included. Make sure the tests run and pass (`Command + U` to run them) before you submit!
* After that, you may submit the 2 appropriate files to your recruiter.
